# Banking System Database Project

## Project Overview
A comprehensive SQL database system designed for banking operations, implementing complex relationships between customers, accounts, transactions, and security features. The system demonstrates advanced SQL concepts and database management skills through real-world banking scenarios.

## Database Schema
The database consists of multiple interconnected entities managing various banking operations:
- Customer Management (Customer, CustomerAccount)
- Account Operations (Account, AccountType, AccountStatusType)
- Transaction Handling (Transaction, TransactionType, FailedTransaction)
- Security Implementation (UserLogin, UserSecurityAnswers, UserSecurityQuestions)
- Employee Management (Employee)

## Technical Implementation

### Key Features
- Multi-level account management system
- Secure user authentication and authorization
- Comprehensive transaction tracking
- Failed transaction logging and monitoring
- Customer relationship management
- Employee data management

### SQL Concepts Demonstrated
- Complex JOIN operations (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT joins)
- Stored Procedures for routine operations
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for advanced queries
- Primary and Foreign Key constraints
- Data integrity through proper relationships
- Transaction management
- Index optimization

### Advanced Queries Implemented
- Account balance calculation and updates
- Transaction history tracking
- Customer profile management
- Security question handling
